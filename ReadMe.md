<h1 align="center">AirBnB Mobile Application</h1>

<p>This project is a mobile application created with React Native replicating some of the functionality of AirBnB with the key features including:
<ul>
<li>Sign in and sign up options using local storage to save user details</li>
<li>Mapping of AirBnB rooms data using Google Maps to show the relative location</li>
<li>An Around Me tab to show rooms based on current location using longitude and latitude - note this is currently fixed in the code to center around Paris due to the limited data set but the dynamic code can be uncommented.</li>
</ul>
This application is deployable on both Android and iOS and requires the installation of Expo to view on your local machine</p>
